List of Cuts:

- Only one proton track reconstructed:
	- Momentum of proton track constrained to between ~100 MeV to ~1500 MeV

- Proton track begins in FGD

- Number of reconstructed tracks:	

	4: proton muon (different vertices) electron positron (+ No ECal clusters?)
	3: proton (and from different vertex:) electron positron (+ No ECal clusters?)
	2: proton muon (from same vertex) + ECal clusters
	1: proton + ECal clusters

Is it possible to tell direction from ECal cluster?








Exactly one proton --> Put in PID cut 

Both FGDs

More than one ECal cluster

Number of tracks ok
