# UOWFourthYearProjectOriginal
An archive of the code originally used in my fourth year project at the University of Warwick

-----

When I was at the University of Warwick, in the fourth year of undergraduate physics, we had to complete a research project. Mine was on the detection of delta baryon events caused by neutrinos coming from the Tokai-Kamioka (T2K) Experiment.

This repository contains an archive of the original code we wrote, as it was at the end of the project in March 2013. We didn't use GitHub or Git (or indeed any kind of source control) when we were doing the project. I'm uploading this code now (2017.12.09) so that I can look back at it easily, and compare it to the more recent projects I've done.

The original code is VERY, VERY messy. It was the first time we'd used Python, and the first time we'd coded anything of this kind of this scale. Part of the reason why the code is so messy is _because_ we didn't use source control. But another reason is because, having not used Python before, there was no real structure to the code.
